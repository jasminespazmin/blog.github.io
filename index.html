        <p>Frogger is not controversial. Everyone loves it.Frogger is a great game and I really like it. The Con's of this game is the current resolution available. We are currently
      working on a higher quality version that will include multiple characters and a story mode. It will be at least three levels
      more complicated then the current version. The pros are that you don't have to worry about being online because it can be easily download to most devices because
      it doesn't take up much space on your hardrive. Another con is that it can get repetetive once you get very good at it. However
      it takes many game hourse to get to that point.Frogger is a great game and I really like it. The Con's of this game is the current resolution available. We are currently
